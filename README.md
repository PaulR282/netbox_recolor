# netbox_recolor

Since I didn't like the new color of netbox, I wrote this plugin to recolor it to blue. It is optimised for dark mode, you might want to use a darker blue for light mode.
You can edit `recolor.html` to  change the color scheme to your preference. You might also want to replace the logo by replacing `/opt/netbox/netbox/project-static/img/logo_netbox_bright_teal.svg` and/or `/opt/netbox/netbox/project-static/img/logo_netbox_dark_teal.svg` with the old logo in this repo.
